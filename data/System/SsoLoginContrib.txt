---+!! SSO Login Contrib Package
<div class="foswikiHelp"> *Currently not functional*   This extension
currently loops in the =Foswiki::LoginManager::SsoLogin::new()= routine.  

With Foswiki, the user identity is not established during module
initialization. It probably should be done in the getUser() routine.  This
needs more work.

---++ Introduction

[[Wikipedia:Single_sign-on][Single sign-on]] (SSO) is a property of access control of multiple related, but independent software systems. With this property a user logs in once and gains access to all systems without being prompted to log in again at each of them. Conversely, Single sign-off is the property whereby a single action of signing out terminates access to multiple software systems.

The !SsoLoginContrib is a login manager for Foswiki that handles cookie based SSO authentication. This requires a SSO authentication service on the same domain.

   * A user logs in to the example.com domain; a domain-level cookie named =x-example-authtoken= is set; the value of the cookie is an auth token, such as =auth:1234-5678-9abcd=.
   * The user visits twiki.example.com; because the =x-example-authtoken= cookie is a domain level cookie, the browser will send that cookie to all requests on that site.
   * The !SsoLoginContrib looks for the presence of =x-example-authtoken= and, if present, will pass its value to an SSO API on example.com for verification.
   * The actual SSO API is something like =https://example.com/api/auth/&lt;authtoken&gt;=, where =&lt;authtoken&gt;= is replaced by the cookie value.
   * Some SSO APIs require to pass an API key in the HTTP header as part of that API call; such as: %BR%
     =x-example-key: abcd-ef01-2345-6789=
   * The SSO API call returns either:
      * A 403 error code, which means it's either a bad/expired auth token or the API key is not valid/present/has-been-denied-access
      * A 200 code with JSON in the response body
   * The JSON response depends on the SSO API, and may look something like the following: %BR%
     ={"type":"named", "displayName":"Jimmy Neutron", "loginName":"jimmy@example.com"}=
   * The !SsoLoginContrib uses the login name found in the JSON response to set the authenticated user in Foswiki. Foswiki has three representations for authenticated users:
      * USERNAME (login name), example =jimmy@example.com=, you are <nop>%USERNAME%
      * Canonical User ID, example =jimmy_40example_2ecom=, this is built from the login name
      * WIKINAMENAME, example =Jimmyexamplecom= or =JimmyNeutron=, you are <nop>%WIKINAME%

   * If the user is not logged in, Foswiki will show a "login" link that points to the SSO service to login, else a "logout" link is shown that points to the SSO service to log out.

   * Users do not need to register in Foswiki, but they can if they want to have their own Foswiki profile page, or if their !WikiName needs to be added to %USERSWEB%.FoswikiGroups.
      * Unregistered users will have a "WikiName" built by stripping out non-ASCII characters from the login name. For example, =jimmy@example.com= becomes =Jimmyexamplecom=, and user signatures point to =%USERSWEB%.Jimmyexamplecom=.
      * Registered users will have profile page with their %SYSTEMWEB%.WikiName as the page name, such as =JimmyNeutron=. The mapping from login name to !WikiName is done in the %USERSWEB%.FoswikiUsers page - fix entries there in case login names change.

---++ Configuration

Run the [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%][configure]] script and set the following settings. Alternatively, edit the =lib/LocalSite.cfg= configure file directly. Settings:

<blockquote><verbatim>
# ---+ Security setup section

# ---++ Authentication

# enable SSO login:
$Foswiki::cfg{LoginManager} = 'Foswiki::LoginManager::SsoLogin';

# remove the "@" character from the login name filter in case users login with an e-mail address:
$Foswiki::cfg{LoginNameFilterIn} = '^[^\\s\\*?~^\\$%`"\'&;|<>\\x00-\\x1f]+$';

# ---++ Registration

# allow login name, and don't ask for password in registration page:
$Foswiki::cfg{Register}{AllowLoginName} = 1;

# ---++ Passwords

# no password manager:
$Foswiki::cfg{PasswordManager} = 'none';

# ---+ Extensions section

# name of auth token cookie:
$Foswiki::cfg{SsoLoginContrib}{AuthTokenName} = 'x-authtoken-cookie-name';

# URL of SSO API to verify an auth token; %AUTHTOKEN% is set to the cookie value of the auth token
$Foswiki::cfg{SsoLoginContrib}{VerifyAuthTokenUrl} = 'https://example.com/api/auth/%AUTHTOKEN%';

# Some SSO APIs require to pass a key in the header of the http request; use comma-space delimited list:
$Foswiki::cfg{SsoLoginContrib}{VerifyAuthTokenHeader} = 'x-sso-api-key, API key value';

# regular expression to extract the login name from the JSON response:
$Foswiki::cfg{SsoLoginContrib}{VerifyResponseLoginRE} = '"loginName":"([^"]*)';

# login URL; %ORIGURL% is set to the original URL where the user is sent after login:
$Foswiki::cfg{SsoLoginContrib}{LoginUrl} = 'https://example.com/login?redirect=%ORIGURL%';

# logout URL; %ORIGURL% is set to the original URL where the user is sent after logout:
$Foswiki::cfg{SsoLoginContrib}{LogoutUrl} = 'https://example.com/logout?redirect=%ORIGURL%';
</verbatim></blockquote>
